Socks is a SOCKS 4/5 server with bandwidth limiting capabilities.
It's used to connect a small network to the internet and/or limit 
bandwidth used by certain services.

Socks has been tested and is known to work under the following platforms:
* Slackware ? GNU/Linux 2.4 with g++ version 3.2.2.
* Solaris 8.0 with g++ version 3.?
* OpenBSD 3.4 with g++ version 3.?
Pretty much any new system that is POSIX compatible should work without too
much trouble.

To install unpack socks and enter the socks/src directory. Type make and select
operating system. Once the compilation finishes move the socks binary to
where you want it (often /usr/local/sbin). Don't forget to also move the
socks.conf configuration file to your favourite configuratution directory
(often /usr/local/etc).

Befory you start socks open the configuration file (/usr/local/etc/socks.conf)
in your editor and make the changes you want. The configuration file is
commented and pretty straightforward. The only thing that is *really* important
is to set the listen interfaces correctly since a misconfiguration might let
anyone relay connections through the program.

To start socks simply type: socks [full path to socks.conf].
